# Walmart-Data-Analysis-Python-Project
Walmart Data Analysis Summary
In this analysis, I utilized Python to derive key insights from Walmart's data, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to assess various business metrics. Using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and performed necessary transformations for accurate analysis.
Sales Performance: Analyzed total sales, average sales per store, and identified trends across different time periods.
Product Analysis: Evaluated product performance, including top-selling items and least-performing products, to understand inventory demands.
Customer Behavior: Analyzed patterns in customer purchases, identifying peak shopping times and preferred product categories.
Regional Analysis: Assessed sales by region, identifying high- and low-performing locations and exploring potential causes.

Problem Statement:
The Superstore dataset provides sales and profit data for a variety of products across different categories and regions.
The goal of this project is to analyze the data and identify insights that can help the company improve its business performance. 
Specifically, we aim to answer questions such as: which product categories are the most profitable? Which regions have the highest sales and profit? What are the most profitable products? 
By answering these questions, we hope to provide recommendations for the company on how to optimize its product offerings and improve its revenue and profitability.

Research questions:
Which product categories have the highest profit margins in the Super Store?
Are there any significant differences in sales between the East region and other regions?
How do sales vary by product category during different months of the year?
What is the rate of returned products for orders with same-day shipping compared to other shipping options?
How do sales and profit vary by product category on weekdays compared to weekends?

Formulate hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Technology products have the highest profit margin compared to other product categories.
Hypothesis 2: The East region has the highest sales compared to other regions.
Hypothesis 3: Sales are higher during certain months of the year.
Hypothesis 4: Orders with same-day shipping have the lowest rate of returned products.
Hypothesis 5: The company's profit is more on weekdays than on weekends.

This analysis provided actionable insights, helping understand Walmart's sales trends and customer preferences to support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
